# [Quillpad](https://github.com/quillpad/quillpad) website

## Building from source
1.  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/noClaps/quillpad-website.git
    cd quillpad-website
    ```
2. Configure the settings in [config.yaml](config.yaml).
3.  ```sh
    hugo server
    ```
    Run this in the root directory (`quillpad-website/` if you followed the instructions above), and open `localhost:1313` in your desired browser to see the preview. Make sure to keep Hugo up-to-date as well as this repository, especially if you plan to contribute.
4.  ```sh
    hugo
    ```
    This builds the site and places the files in the `public/` directory.
